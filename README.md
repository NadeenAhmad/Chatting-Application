*  Developing a network application based on the client/server architecture, using java to simulate multi-threaded server where clients can connect and communicate, this project was more developed to handle two servers communicating together where clients on both ends can benefit from one-to-one chat

* After getting connected to the server, a user must provide his or her name to enter the chat.
